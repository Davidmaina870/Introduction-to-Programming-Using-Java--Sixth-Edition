<section id="GUI1.3" title="Graphics and Painting">

<p><start><big>E</big>verything you see on a computer screen</start> has to be
drawn there, even the text. The Java API includes a range of classes and
methods that are devoted to drawing. In this section, I'll look at some of the
most basic of these.</p>

<p>The physical structure of a GUI is built of components. The term <newword>component</newword>
refers to a visual element in a GUI, including buttons, menus, text-input boxes, scroll bars,
check boxes, and so on. In Java,
GUI components are represented by objects belonging to subclasses of the class
<code>java.awt.Component</code>. Most components in the Swing GUI&mdash;although not
top-level components like JApplet and JFrame&mdash;belong to subclasses of the class
<code>javax.swing.JComponent</code>, which is itself a subclass of <code>java.awt.Component</code>.
Every component is responsible for drawing
itself. If you want to use a standard component, you only have to
add it to your applet or frame. You don't have to worry about painting it on the screen.
That will happen automatically, since it already knows how to draw itself.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, you do want to draw on a component. You will have to do
this whenever you want to display something that is not included among the
standard, pre-defined component classes. When you want to do this, you have to
define your own component class and provide a method in that class for drawing
the component.  I will always use a subclass of <classname>JPanel</classname>
when I need a drawing surface of this kind, as I did for the
<classname>MessageDisplay</classname> class in the example
<sourceref href="HelloWorldApplet.java"/> in the 
<localref href="GUI1.2">previous section</localref>.
A JPanel, like any JComponent, draws its content in the method</p>

<pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g)</pre>

<np>To create a drawing surface, you should define a subclass of <code>JPanel</code>
and provide a custom <code>paintComponent()</code> method. Create an object
belonging to this class and use it in your applet or frame. When the time comes
for your component to be drawn on the screen, the system will call its
<code>paintComponent()</code> to do the drawing. That is, the code that you put
into the <code>paintComponent()</code> method will be executed whenever the
panel needs to be drawn on the screen; by writing this method, you determine
the picture that will be displayed in the panel.</np>

<p>Note that the <code>paintComponent()</code> method has a parameter of type
<classname>Graphics</classname>. The <classname>Graphics</classname> object will be provided by the system
when it calls your method. You need this object to do the actual drawing. To do
any drawing at all in Java, you need a <newword>graphics context</newword>.
A graphics context is an object belonging to the class
<code>java.awt.Graphics</code>.  Instance methods are provided in this class for
drawing shapes, text, and images. Any given <classname>Graphics</classname> object can draw
to only one location. In this chapter, that location will always be a GUI
component belonging to some subclass of <code>JPanel</code>. The
<classname>Graphics</classname> class is an abstract class, which means that it is impossible
to create a graphics context directly, with a constructor. There are actually
two ways to get a graphics context for drawing on a component: First of all, of
course, when the <code>paintComponent()</code> method of a component is called by
the system, the parameter to that method is a graphics context for drawing on
the component. Second, every component has an instance method called
<code>getGraphics()</code>. This method is a function that returns a graphics
context that can be used for drawing on the component outside its
<code>paintComponent()</code> method. The official line is that you should
<b>not</b> do this, and I will almost always avoid it. But I have
found it convenient to use <code>getGraphics()</code> in a few examples.</p>
   
<p>The <code>paintComponent()</code> method in the <classname>JPanel</classname>
class simply fills the panel with the panel's background color.  When defining a
subclass of <classname>JPanel</classname> for use as a drawing surface, you will
usually want to fill the panel with the background color before drawing
other content onto the panel (although it is not necessary to do this if the drawing
commands in the method cover the background of the component completely).
This is traditionally done with a call to
<code>super.paintComponent(g)</code>, so most <code>paintComponent()</code>
methods that you write will have the form:</p>
   
<pre>public void paintComponent(g) {
   super.paintComponent(g);
   . . . // Draw the content of the component.
}</pre>
   


<break/>

<p>Most components do, in fact, do all drawing operations in their
<code>paintComponent()</code> methods. What happens if, in the middle of some other
method, you realize that the content of the component needs to be changed? You
should <b>not</b> call <code>paintComponent()</code> directly to make the
change; this method is meant to be called only by the system. Instead, you have
to inform the system that the component needs to be redrawn, and let the system
do its job by calling <code>paintComponent()</code>. You do this by calling the
component's <code>repaint()</code> method. The method</p>

<pre>public void repaint();</pre>

<np>is defined in the <code>Component</code> class, and so can be used with any
component. You should call <code>repaint()</code> to inform the system that the
component needs to be redrawn. It is important to understand that the 
<code>repaint()</code> method returns
immediately, without doing any painting itself. The system will call the
component's <code>paintComponent()</code> method <i>later</i>, as soon as it gets
a chance to do so, after processing other pending events if there are any.</np>

<p>Note that the system can also call <code>paintComponent()</code> for other
reasons. It is called when the component first appears on the screen. It will
also be called if the size of the component changes, which can happen when
the user resizes the window that contains the component.  In versions of Java
earlier than Java&nbsp;6, <code>paintComponent()</code> is also called if the 
component is covered up and then uncovered, since the system did not 
automatically save a copy of the content.  (And even in Java&nbsp;6, the content
is not automatically saved if is drawn with a graphics context created by
<code>getGraphics()</code>, as I will do in some examples.)   In any case,
<code>paintComponent()</code> should be capable of redrawing the content
of the component on demand.  As you will see, however, some of our early examples 
will not be able to do this correctly.</p>

<p>This means that, to work properly, the <code>paintComponent()</code> method must
be smart enough to correctly redraw the component at any time. To make this
possible, a program should store data in its instance variables
about the state of the component. These variables should contain all the information
necessary to redraw the component completely. The <code>paintComponent()</code>
method should use the data in these variables to decide what to draw. When the
program wants to change the content of the component, it should not simply draw
the new content. It should change the values of the relevant variables and call
<code>repaint()</code>. When the system calls <code>paintComponent()</code>, that
method will use the new values of the variables and will draw the component
with the desired modifications. This might seem a roundabout way of doing
things. Why not just draw the modifications directly? There are at least two
reasons. First of all, it really does turn out to be easier to get things right
if all drawing is done in one method. Second, even if you do make
modifications directly, you still have to make the
<code>paintComponent()</code> method aware of them in some way so that it will be
able to <b>redraw</b> the component correctly on demand.</p>

<p>You will see how all this works in practice as we work through examples in
the rest of this chapter. For now, we will spend the rest of this section
looking at how to get some actual drawing done.</p>

<subsection id="GUI1.3.1" title="Coordinates">

<p>The screen of a computer is a grid of little squares called <newword>pixels</newword>.
The color of each pixel can be set individually, and
drawing on the screen just means setting the colors of individual pixels.</p>

<img height="184" width="326" align="right" alt="" src="gui_coordinates.png" 
   tex="gui_coordinates.eps" texscale="0.75"/>

<p>A graphics context draws in a rectangle made up of pixels. A position in the
rectangle is specified by a pair of integer coordinates, <code>(x,y)</code>. The
upper left corner has coordinates <code>(0,0)</code>. The <code>x</code> coordinate
increases from left to right, and the <code>y</code> coordinate increases from top
to bottom. The illustration shows a 16-by-10 pixel component (with
very large pixels). A small line, rectangle, and oval are shown as they would
be drawn by coloring individual pixels. (Note that, properly speaking, the
coordinates don't belong to the pixels but to the grid lines between them.)</p>

<p>For any component, you can find out the size of the rectangle that it
occupies by calling the instance methods <code>getWidth()</code> and
<code>getHeight()</code>, which return the number of pixels in the
horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.  In general, it's not
a good idea to assume that you know the size of a component, since the
size is often set by a layout manager and can even change if the component
is in a window and that window is resized by the user.   This means that it's good
form to check the size of a component before doing any drawing on that
component. For example, you can use a <code>paintComponent()</code> method that
looks like:</p>

<pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
   super.paintComponent(g);
   int width =  getWidth();   // Find out the width of this component.
   int height = getHeight();  // Find out its height.
   . . .   // Draw the content of the component.
}</pre>

<p>Of course, your drawing commands will have to take the size into account.
That is, they will have to use <code>(x,y)</code> coordinates that are calculated
based on the actual height and width of the component.</p>

</subsection>
   
<subsection id="GUI1.3.2" title="Colors">
   
<p>You will probably want to use some color when you draw.
Java is designed to work with the <newword>RGB color system</newword>.
An RGB color is specified by three numbers that give the level
of red, green, and blue, respectively, in the color. A color in Java is an
object of the class, <code>java.awt.Color</code>. You can construct a new color by
specifying its red, blue, and green components. For example,</p>

<pre>Color myColor = new Color(r,g,b);</pre>

<np>There are two constructors that you can call in this way. In the one that I
almost always use, <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code> are integers in the
range 0 to 255. In the other, they are numbers of type <ptype>float</ptype> in the
range 0.0F to 1.0F. (Recall that a literal of type <ptype>float</ptype> is
written with an "F" to distinguish it from a <ptype>double</ptype> number.) Often,
you can avoid constructing new colors altogether, since the <classname>Color</classname>
class defines several named constants representing common colors: <code>Color.WHITE</code>,
<code>Color.BLACK</code>, <code>Color.RED</code>, <code>Color.GREEN</code>,
<code>Color.BLUE</code>, <code>Color.CYAN</code>, <code>Color.MAGENTA</code>,
<code>Color.YELLOW</code>, <code>Color.PINK</code>, <code>Color.ORANGE</code>,
<code>Color.LIGHT_GRAY</code>, <code>Color.GRAY</code>, and <code>Color.DARK_GRAY</code>.
(There are older, alternative names for these constants that use lower case rather than
upper case constants, such as <code>Color.red</code> instead of <code>Color.RED</code>,
but the upper case versions are preferred because they follow the convention that
constant names should be upper case.)</np>

<p>An alternative to RGB is the <newword>HSB color system</newword>.
In the HSB system, a color is specified by three numbers called the
<newword>hue</newword>, the <newword>saturation</newword>,
and the <newword>brightness</newword>. The hue is the basic color,
ranging from red through orange through all the other colors of the rainbow.
The brightness is pretty much what it sounds like. A fully saturated color is a
pure color tone. Decreasing the saturation is like mixing white or gray paint
into the pure color. In Java, the hue, saturation and brightness are always
specified by values of type <ptype>float</ptype> in the range from 0.0F to 1.0F. The
<classname>Color</classname> class has a <code>static</code> member function named
<code>getHSBColor</code> for creating HSB colors. To create the color with HSB
values given by <code>h</code>, <code>s</code>, and <code>b</code>, you can say:</p>

<pre>Color myColor = Color.getHSBColor(h,s,b);</pre>

<np>For example, to make a color with a random hue that is as bright and as
saturated as possible, you could use:</np>

<pre>Color randomColor = Color.getHSBColor( (float)Math.random(), 1.0F, 1.0F );</pre>

<np>The type cast is necessary because the value returned by
<code>Math.random()</code> is of type <ptype>double</ptype>, and
<code>Color.getHSBColor()</code> requires values of type <ptype>float</ptype>. (By the
way, you might ask why RGB colors are created using a constructor while HSB
colors are created using a static member function. The problem is that we would
need two different constructors, both of them with three parameters of type
<ptype>float</ptype>. Unfortunately, this is impossible. You can have two
constructors only if the number of parameters or the parameter types differ.)</np>

<p>The RGB system and the HSB system are just different ways of describing the
same set of colors. It is possible to translate between one system and the
other. The best way to understand the color systems is to experiment with them.
<tex>In the on-line version of this section, you will find an applet that
you can use to experiment with RGB and HSB colors.</tex>   
<web>In the following applet, you can use the scroll bars to control the RGB and HSB
values of a color. A sample of the color is shown on the right side of the
applet.</web></p>

<webdiv>
<applet code="ColorChooserApplet.class" width="530" height="199" 
   alt="(Applet 'ColorChooserApplet' should be displayed here.)"/>
</webdiv>

<p>One of the properties of a <classname>Graphics</classname> object is the current
drawing color, which is used for all drawing of shapes and text. If <code>g</code>
is a graphics context, you can change the current drawing color for <code>g</code>
using the method <code>g.setColor(c)</code>, where <code>c</code> is a <classname>Color</classname>.
For example, if you want to draw in green, you would just say
<code>g.setColor(Color.GREEN)</code> before doing the drawing. The graphics context
continues to use the color until you explicitly change it with another
<code>setColor()</code> command. If you want to know what the current drawing color
is, you can call the function <code>g.getColor()</code>, which returns an object of
type <classname>Color</classname>. This can be useful if you want to change to another
drawing color temporarily and then restore the previous drawing color.</p>

<p>Every component has an associated <newword>foreground color</newword> and 
<newword>background color</newword>. Generally, the
component is filled with the background color before anything else is drawn
(although some components are "transparent," meaning that the background color
is ignored). When a new graphics context is created for a component, the
current drawing color is set to the foreground color. Note that the foreground
color and background color are properties of the component, not of a graphics
context.</p>

<p>The foreground and background colors can be set by instance methods
<code>setForeground(c)</code> and <code>setBackground(c)</code>, which are defined in
the <code>Component</code> class and therefore are available for use with any
component.  This can be useful even for standard components, if you want them
to use colors that are different from the defaults.</p>

</subsection>
   
<subsection id="GUI1.3.3" title="Fonts">
   
<p>A <newword>font</newword> represents a particular size and style
of text. The same character will appear different in different fonts. In Java,
a font is characterized by a font name, a style, and a size. The available font
names are system dependent, but you can always use the following four strings
as font names: "Serif", "SansSerif", "Monospaced", and "Dialog".  (A "serif" is a
little decoration on a character, such as a short horizontal line at the bottom
of the letter i. "SansSerif" means "without serifs." "Monospaced" means that
all the characters in the font have the same width. The "Dialog" font is the
one that is typically used in dialog boxes.)</p>

<p>The style of a font is specified using named constants that are defined in
the <classname>Font</classname> class. You can specify the style as one of the four
values:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Font.PLAIN</code>,</li>
<li><code>Font.ITALIC</code>,</li>
<li><code>Font.BOLD</code>, or</li>
<li><code>Font.BOLD + Font.ITALIC</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The size of a font is an integer. Size typically ranges from about 10 to 36,
although larger sizes can also be used. The size of a font is usually about
equal to the height of the largest characters in the font, in pixels, but this
is not an exact rule. The size of the default font is 12.</p>

<p>Java uses the class named <code>java.awt.Font</code> for representing fonts. You
can construct a new font by specifying its font name, style, and size in a
constructor:</p>

<pre>Font plainFont = new Font("Serif", Font.PLAIN, 12);
Font bigBoldFont = new Font("SansSerif", Font.BOLD, 24);</pre>

<p>Every graphics context has a current font, which is used for drawing text.
You can change the current font with the <code>setFont()</code> method. For
example, if <code>g</code> is a graphics context and <code>bigBoldFont</code> is a
font, then the command <code>g.setFont(bigBoldFont)</code> will set the current
font of <code>g</code> to <code>bigBoldFont</code>. The new font will be used
for any text that is drawn <i>after</i> the <code>setFont()</code> command is given.
You can find out the current font
of <code>g</code> by calling the method <code>g.getFont()</code>, which returns an
object of type <classname>Font</classname>.</p>

<p>Every component has an associated font. It can be set with the instance
method <code>setFont(font)</code>, which is defined in the <code>Component</code>
class. When a graphics context is created for drawing on a component, the
graphic context's current font is set equal to the font of the component.</p>

</subsection>
   
<subsection id="GUI1.3.4" title="Shapes">

<p>The <classname>Graphics</classname> class includes a large number of instance methods for
drawing various shapes, such as lines, rectangles, and ovals. The shapes are
specified using the <code>(x,y)</code> coordinate system described above. They are
drawn in the current drawing color of the graphics context. The current drawing
color is set to the foreground color of the component when the graphics context
is created, but it can be changed at any time using the <code>setColor()</code>
method.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the most important drawing methods. With all these
commands, any drawing that is done outside the boundaries of the component is
ignored. Note that all these methods are in the <classname>Graphics</classname> class, so
they all must be called through an object of type <classname>Graphics</classname>.</p>

<ul>
<li><codedef>drawString(String str, int x, int y)</codedef> &mdash; Draws
the text given by the string <code>str</code>. The string is drawn using
the current color and font of the graphics context. <code>x</code> specifies the
position of the left end of the string. <code>y</code> is the y-coordinate of the
baseline of the string. The baseline is a horizontal line on which the
characters rest. Some parts of the characters, such as the tail on a y or g,
extend below the baseline.</li>

<li><codedef>drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)</codedef> &mdash; Draws 
a line from the point <code>(x1,y1)</code> to the point
<code>(x2,y2)</code>. The line is drawn as if with a pen that hangs one pixel to
the right and one pixel down from the <code>(x,y)</code> point where the pen is
located. For example, if <code>g</code> refers to an object of type
<classname>Graphics</classname>, then the command <code>g.drawLine(x,y,x,y)</code>, which
corresponds to putting the pen down at a point, colors the single pixel with upper left corner
at the point <code>(x,y)</code>.</li>

<li><codedef>drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height)</codedef> &mdash; Draws 
the outline of a rectangle. The upper left corner
is at <code>(x,y)</code>, and the width and height of the rectangle are as
specified. If <code>width</code> equals <code>height</code>, then the rectangle is a
square. If the <code>width</code> or the <code>height</code> is negative, then nothing
is drawn. The rectangle is drawn with the same pen that is used for
<code>drawLine()</code>. This means that the actual width of the rectangle as drawn
is <code>width+1</code>, and similarly for the height. There is an extra pixel
along the right edge and the bottom edge. For example, if you want to draw a
rectangle around the edges of the component, you can say "<code>g.drawRect(0, 0,
getWidth()-1, getHeight()-1);</code>", where <code>g</code> is a graphics
context for the component.  If you use "<code>g.drawRect(0, 0,
getWidth(), getHeight());</code>", then the right and bottom edges of the
rectangle will be drawn <i>outside</i> the component and will not appear
on the screen.</li>

<li><codedef>drawOval(int x, int y, int width, int height)</codedef> &mdash; Draws
the outline of an oval. The oval is one that just
fits inside the rectangle specified by <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>,
and <code>height</code>. If <code>width</code> equals <code>height</code>, the oval is a
circle.</li>

<li><codedef>drawRoundRect(int x, int y, int width, int height,
int xdiam, int ydiam)</codedef> &mdash; Draws the outline of a rectangle with
rounded corners. The basic rectangle is specified by <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
<code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>, but the corners are rounded. The degree of
rounding is given by <code>xdiam</code> and <code>ydiam</code>. The corners are arcs of
an ellipse with horizontal diameter <code>xdiam</code> and vertical diameter
<code>ydiam</code>. A typical value for <code>xdiam</code> and <code>ydiam</code> is 16,
but the value used should really depend on how big the rectangle is.</li>

<li><codedef>draw3DRect(int x, int y, int width, int height,
boolean raised)</codedef> &mdash; Draws the outline of a rectangle that is
supposed to have a three-dimensional effect, as if it is raised from the screen
or pushed into the screen. The basic rectangle is specified by <code>x</code>,
<code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>. The <code>raised</code> parameter
tells whether the rectangle seems to be raised from the screen or pushed into
it. The 3D effect is achieved by using brighter and darker versions of the
drawing color for different edges of the rectangle. The documentation
recommends setting the drawing color equal to the background color before using
this method. The effect won't work well for some colors.</li>

<li><codedef>drawArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int
startAngle, int arcAngle)</codedef> &mdash; Draws part of the oval that just fits
inside the rectangle specified by <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, and
<code>height</code>. The part drawn is an arc that extends <code>arcAngle</code>
degrees from a starting angle at <code>startAngle</code> degrees. Angles are
measured with 0 degrees at the 3 o'clock position (the positive direction of
the horizontal axis). Positive angles are measured counterclockwise from zero,
and negative angles are measured clockwise. To get an arc of a circle, make
sure that <code>width</code> is equal to <code>height</code>.</li>

<li><codedef>fillRect(int x, int y, int width, int
height)</codedef> &mdash; Draws a filled-in rectangle. This fills in the interior
of the rectangle that would be drawn by <code>drawRect(x,y,width,height)</code>.
The extra pixel along the bottom and right edges is not included. The
<code>width</code> and <code>height</code> parameters give the exact width and height
of the rectangle. For example, if you wanted to fill in the entire component,
you could say "<code>g.fillRect(0, 0, getWidth(),
getHeight());</code>"</li>

<li><codedef>fillOval(int x, int y, int width, int
height)</codedef> &mdash; Draws a filled-in oval.</li>

<li><codedef>fillRoundRect(int x, int y, int width, int height,
int xdiam, int ydiam)</codedef> &mdash; Draws a filled-in rounded rectangle.</li>

<li><codedef>fill3DRect(int x, int y, int width, int height,
boolean raised)</codedef> &mdash; Draws a filled-in three-dimensional
rectangle.</li>

<li><codedef>fillArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int
startAngle, int arcAngle)</codedef> &mdash; Draw a filled-in arc. This looks like
a wedge of pie, whose crust is the arc that would be drawn by the
<code>drawArc</code> method.</li>

</ul>

<subsection  id="GUI1.3.5" title="Graphics2D">

<p>All drawing in Java is done through an object of type <classname>Graphics</classname>. The
<classname>Graphics</classname> class provides basic commands for such things as drawing
shapes and text and  for selecting a drawing color. These commands are adequate in many cases, but
they fall far short of what's needed in a serious computer graphics program.
Java has another class, <classname>Graphics2D</classname>, that provides a larger
set of drawing operations. <classname>Graphics2D</classname> is a sub-class of
<classname>Graphics</classname>, so all the methods from the <classname>Graphics</classname> class are
also available in a <classname>Graphics2D</classname>.</p>

<p>The <code>paintComponent()</code> method of a <code>JComponent</code> gives you a
graphics context of type <classname>Graphics</classname> that you can use for drawing on the
component. In fact, the graphics context actually belongs to the sub-class
<classname>Graphics2D</classname> (in Java version 1.2 and later), and can be type-cast to
gain access to the advanced <classname>Graphics2D</classname> drawing methods:</p>

<pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
   super.paintComponent(g);
   Graphics2D g2;
   g2 = (Graphics2D)g;
    .
    . // Draw on the component using g2.
    .
}</pre>

<p>Drawing in <classname>Graphics2D</classname> is based on shapes, which are objects that
implement an interface named <classname>Shape</classname>. Shape classes include
<classname>Line2D</classname>, <classname>Rectangle2D</classname>, 
<classname>Ellipse2D</classname>, <classname>Arc2D</classname>, and
<classname>GeneralPath</classname>, among others; all these classes are defined in the
package <code>java.awt.geom</code>.  <classname>Graphics2D</classname>
has methods <code>draw(Shape)</code> and <code>fill(Shape)</code> for drawing the
outline of a shape and for filling its interior. Advanced capabilities include:
lines that are more than one pixel thick, dotted and dashed lines, filling a
shape with a texture (that is, with a repeated image), filling a shape with a
gradient, and so-called "anti-aliased" drawing (which cuts down on the jagged
appearance along a slanted line or curve).</p>

<p>In the <classname>Graphics</classname> class, coordinates are specified as integers and
are based on pixels. The shapes that are used with <classname>Graphics2D</classname> use real
numbers for coordinates, and they are not necessarily bound to pixels. In fact,
you can change the coordinate system and use any coordinates that are
convenient to your application. In computer graphics terms, you can apply a
"transformation" to the coordinate system. The transformation can be any
combination of translation, scaling, and rotation.</p>
   
<p>I mention <classname>Graphics2D</classname> here for completeness.
I will not use any of the advanced capabilities of <classname>Graphics2D</classname> in
this chapter, but I will cover a few of them in <localref href="GUI2.2"/>.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection id="GUI1.3.6" title="An Example">
   
<p>Let's use some of the material covered in this section to write a subclass
of <classname>JPanel</classname> for use as a drawing surface.  The panel can then be used in either an
applet or a frame, as discussed in <localref href="GUI1.2.2"/>.
All the drawing will be done in the
<code>paintComponent()</code> method of the panel class.
The panel will draw multiple copies of a message on a black background.
Each copy of the message is in a random color. Five different fonts are used,
with different sizes and styles. The message can be specified in the constructor;
if the default constructor is used, the message is the string "Java!". The
panel works OK no matter what  its size.  <web>Here's an applet
that uses the panel as its content pane:</web><tex>Here is what the
panel looks like:</tex></p>

<applet code="RandomStringsApplet.class" archive="RandomStrings.jar" width="300" height="180"
alt="(Applet 'RandomStrings' should be displayed here.)" tex="RandomStrings.eps" texscale="0.6"/>

<p>There is one problem with the way this class works. When the panel's
<code>paintComponent()</code> method is called, it chooses random colors, fonts,
and locations for the messages. The information about which colors, fonts, and
locations are used is not stored anywhere. The next time
<code>paintComponent()</code> is called, it will make different random choices and
will draw a different picture. A better approach would be to compute the contents of
the picture elsewhere, outside the <code>paintComponent()</code> method.
Information about the picture would be stored in instance variables, and the
<code>paintComponent()</code> method would use that information to draw the
picture. If <code>paintComponent()</code> is called twice, it should draw the same
picture twice, unless the data has changed in the meantime. Unfortunately, to
store the data for the picture in this applet, we would need to use either
arrays, which will not be covered until <localref href="arrays"/>, or off-screen images, 
which will not be covered until <localref href="GUI2"/>. Other examples in this chapter will suffer from
the same problem.</p>

<p>The source for the panel class is shown below. I use an instance variable called
<code>message</code> to hold the message that the panel will display. There are
five instance variables of type <classname>Font</classname> that represent different sizes
and styles of text. These variables are initialized in the constructor
and are used in the <code>paintComponent()</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>paintComponent()</code> method for the panel simply draws 25
copies of the message. For each copy, it chooses one of the five fonts at
random, and it calls <code>g.setFont()</code> to select that font for drawing the
text. It creates a random HSB color and uses <code>g.setColor()</code> to select
that color for drawing. It then chooses random <code>(x,y)</code> coordinates for
the location of the message. The <code>x</code> coordinate gives the horizontal
position of the left end of the string. The formula used for the <code>x</code>
coordinate, "<code>-50 + (int)(Math.random() * (width+40))</code>" gives a random
integer in the range from <code>-50</code> to <code>width-10</code>. This makes it
possible for the string to extend beyond the left edge or the right edge of the
panel. Similarly, the formula for <code>y</code> allows the string to extend
beyond the top and bottom of the applet.</p>

<np>This class defines a panel, which is not something that can stand on its
own.  To see it on the screen, we have to use it in an applet or a frame.
Here is a simple applet class that uses a <classname>RandomStringsPanel</classname>
as its content pane:</np>
   
   
<pre>
import javax.swing.JApplet;

/**
 * A RandomStringsApplet displays 25 copies of a string, using random colors,
 * fonts, and positions for the copies.  The message can be specified as the
 * value of an applet param with name "message."  If no param with name
 * "message" is present, then the default message "Java!" is displayed.
 * The actual content of the applet is an object of type RandomStringsPanel.
 */
public class RandomStringsApplet extends JApplet {
   
   public void init() {
      String message = getParameter("message");  // If null, "Java" is used.
      RandomStringsPanel content = new RandomStringsPanel(message);
      setContentPane(content);
   }

}</pre>
   
<np>Note that the message to be displayed in the applet can be set using an
applet parameter when the applet is added to an HTML document.
Using applets on Web pages was discussed in <localref href="GUI1.2.4"/>.
Remember that to use the applet on a Web page, you must include both the
panel class file, <code>RandomStringsPanel.class</code>, and the applet
class file, <code>RandomStringsApplet.class</code>, in the same directory
as the HTML document (or, alternatively, bundle the two class files
into a jar file, and put the jar file in the document directory).</np>
   
<p>Instead of writing an applet, of course, we could use the panel in the window of a
stand-alone application.  You can find the source code for a main program
that does this in the file <sourceref href="RandomStringsApp.java"/>.</p>
