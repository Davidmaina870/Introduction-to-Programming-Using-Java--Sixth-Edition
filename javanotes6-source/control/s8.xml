<section id="control.8" title="Introduction to GUI Programming" shorttitle="GUI Programming">

<p><start><big>F</big>or the past two chapters</start>, you've been learning the
sort of programming that is done inside a single subroutine. In the rest of the
text, we'll be more concerned with the larger scale structure of programs, but
the material that you've already learned will be an important foundation for
everything to come.</p>

<p>In this section, before moving on to programming-in-the-large, we'll take a
look at how programming-in-the-small can be used in other contexts besides
text-based, command-line-style programs. We'll do this by taking a short,
introductory look at applets and graphical programming.  The point here is
not so much to understand GUI programming as it is to illustrate that
a knowledge of programming-in-the-small applies to writing the guts of
any subroutine, not just <code>main()</code>.</p>

<p>An <newword>applet</newword> is a Java program that runs on a Web
page. An applet is not a stand-alone application, and it does not have a
<code>main()</code> routine. In fact, an applet is an <b>object</b>
rather than a <b>class</b>.  When Java first appeared on the scene, applets
were one of its major appeals.  Since then, they have become much less important,
although they can still be very useful.  When we study GUI programming
in <localref href="GUI1"/>, we will concentrate on stand-alone GUI programs
rather than on applets, but applets are a good place to start for our
first look at the subject.</p>

<p>When an applet is placed on a Web page,
it is assigned a rectangular area on the page. It is the job of the applet to
draw the contents of that rectangle. When the region needs to be drawn, the Web
page calls a subroutine in the applet to do so. This is not so different from
what happens with stand-alone programs. When such a program needs to be run, the
system calls the <code>main()</code> routine of the program. Similarly, when an
applet needs to be drawn, the Web page calls a subroutine in
the applet. The programmer specifies what happens when this routine is
called by filling in the body of the routine. Programming in the small!
Applets can do other things besides draw themselves, such as responding when
the user clicks the mouse on the applet. Each of the applet's behaviors is
defined by a subroutine. The programmer specifies how the
applet behaves by filling in the bodies of the appropriate subroutines.</p>

<p>To define an applet, you need a class that is a subclass of the built-in
class named <classname>Applet</classname>.  To avoid some technicalities in
this section as well as to make things a little more interesting, we will 
not work with the <classname>Applet</classname> class
directly.  Instead, we will work with a class that I wrote named
<classname>AnimationBase</classname>, which is itself a
subclass of <classname>Applet</classname>.  <classname>AnimationBase</classname>
makes it easy to write simple animations.  A <newword>computer animation</newword> is 
really just a sequence of still images, which are called the <newword>frames</newword>
of the animation.   The computer displays the images one after the other. Each
image differs a bit from the preceding image in the sequence. If the
differences are not too big and if the sequence is displayed quickly enough,
the eye is tricked into perceiving continuous motion.  To create the
animation, you just have to say how to draw each individual frame.
When using <classname>AnimationBase</classname>, you do that by filling
in the inside of a subroutine named <code>drawFrame()</code>.
More specifically, to create an animation using <classname>AnimationBase</classname>,
you have write a class of the form:</p>



<pre>import java.awt.*;
 
public class <bnf>name-of-class</bnf> extends AnimationBase {
 
    public void drawFrame(Graphics g) {
       <bnf>statements</bnf>
    }
    
}</pre>

<np>where <bnf>name-of-class</bnf> is an identifier that
names the class, and the <bnf>statements</bnf> are the
code that actually draws the content of one of the frames of the animation. 
This looks similar to the definition of a
stand-alone program, but there are a few things here that need to be explained,
starting with the first line.</np>

<p>When you write a program, there are certain built-in classes that are
available for you to use. These built-in classes include <classname>System</classname> and
<classname>Math</classname>. If you want to use one of these classes, you don't have to do
anything special. You just go ahead and use it. But Java also has a large
number of standard classes that are there if you want them but that are not
automatically available to your program. (There are just too many of them.) If
you want to use these classes in your program, you have to ask for them first.
The standard classes are grouped into so-called "packages." One of these
packages is called "java.awt". The directive "import
java.awt.*;" makes all the classes from the package java.awt available for use
in your program. The <code>java.awt</code> package contains classes related to graphical
user interface programming, including a class called <code>Graphics</code>. The
<code>Graphics</code> class is referred to in the <code>drawFrame()</code> routine above
and will be used for drawing the frame.</p>

<p>The definition of the class above says that the class "extends
<code>AnimationBase</code>." The <classname>AnimationBase</classname> class
includes all the basic properties and behaviors of applet objects (since it is a subclass
of <classname>Applet</classname>). It also defines the basic properties and behaviors
of animations&mdash;it "extends" class <classname>Applet</classname> by adding in 
this extra stuff.  When you extend <classname>AnimationBase</classname>,
you inherit all these properties and behaviors, and you can add even more stuff, 
in particular the drawing commands that you want to use to create your animation.
</p>

<p>(One more thing needs to be mentioned&mdash;and this is a point where Java's
syntax gets unfortunately confusing. You can skip this explanation until
<localref href="OOP"/> if you want.  Applets are objects, not classes. Instead
of being static members of a class, the subroutines that define the applet's
behavior are part of the applet object. We say that they are "non-static"
subroutines. Of course, objects are related to classes because every object is
described by a class. Now here is the part that can get confusing: Even though
a non-static subroutine is not actually part of a class (in the sense of being
part of the behavior of the class itself), it is nevertheless defined in a class (in
the sense that the Java code that defines the subroutine is part of the Java
code that defines the class). Many objects can be described by the same class.
Each object has its own non-static subroutine. But the common definition of
those subroutines&mdash;the actual Java source code&mdash;is physically part of the
class that <b>describes</b> all the objects. To put it briefly: static subroutines in
a class definition say what the class does; non-static subroutines say what all
the objects described by the class do. The <code>drawFrame()</code> routine is
an example of a non-static subroutine. A stand-alone program's <code>main()</code>
routine is an example of a static subroutine. The distinction doesn't really
matter too much at this point: When working with stand-alone programs, mark
everything with the reserved word, "<code>static</code>"; leave it out when working
with applets. However, the distinction between static and non-static will
become more important later in the course.)</p>

<break/>

<p>Let's write an applet based on <classname>AnimationBase</classname>.  In order to
draw the content, we'll need to know some basic subroutines that are already available for drawing,
just as in writing text-oriented programs we need to know what subroutines are
available for reading and writing text. In Java, the built-in drawing
subroutines are found in objects of the class <classname>Graphics</classname>, one of the
classes in the <code>java.awt</code> package. In our applet's <code>drawFrame()</code> routine, we
can use the <classname>Graphics</classname> object <code>g</code> for drawing. (This object is
provided as a parameter to the <code>drawFrame()</code> routine when that routine is
called.) <classname>Graphics</classname> objects contain many subroutines. I'll mention just
three of them here. You'll encounter more of them in <localref href="GUI1"/>.</p>

<ul>
<li><codedef>g.setColor(c)</codedef>, is called to set the
color that is used for drawing. The parameter, <code>c</code> is an object
belonging to a class named <classname>Color</classname>, another one of the classes in the
java.awt package. About a dozen standard colors are available as static member
variables in the <classname>Color</classname> class. These standard colors include
<code>Color.BLACK</code>, <code>Color.WHITE</code>, <code>Color.RED</code>,
<code>Color.GREEN</code>, and <code>Color.BLUE</code>. For example, if you want to draw
in red, you would say "<code>g.setColor(Color.RED);</code>". The specified color is
used for all subsequent drawing operations up until the next time <code>setColor()</code> is
called.</li>
<li><codedef>g.drawRect(x,y,w,h)</codedef> draws the outline
of a rectangle. The parameters <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>w</code>, and
<code>h</code> must be integers or integer-valued expressions. This subroutine draws the outline of the rectangle whose
top-left corner is <code>x</code> pixels from the left edge of the applet and
<code>y</code> pixels down from the top of the applet. The width of the rectangle
is <code>w</code> pixels, and the height is <code>h</code> pixels.  The color that
is used is black, unless a different color has been set by calling <code>setColor()</code>.</li>
<li><codedef>g.fillRect(x,y,w,h)</codedef> is similar to
<code>drawRect</code> except that it fills in the inside of the rectangle instead
of just drawing an outline.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is enough information to write <web>the applet shown here:</web><tex>an
applet that will draw the following image on a Web page:</tex></p>

<applet code="StaticRects" archive="StaticRects.jar" alt="Applet 'StaticRects' should appear here" 
      width="300" height="160" tex="StaticRects.eps" texscale="0.8"/>

<p>Although the applet is defined as an animation, you don't see any movement
because all the frames that are drawn are identical!  This is rather silly, and
we will fix it in the next example.  But for now, we are just interested in seeing
how to use drawing routines to draw a picture.</p>

<p>The applet first fills its entire rectangular area with red. Then it
changes the drawing color to black and draws a sequence of rectangles, where
each rectangle is nested inside the previous one. The rectangles can be drawn
with a <code>while</code> loop, which draws the rectangles starting from the outside
and moving in.   Each time through the loop, the rectangle that is drawn is smaller
than the previous one and is moved down and over a bit. We'll need variables to hold the
width and height of the rectangle and a variable to record how far the top-left
corner of the rectangle is inset from the edges of the applet. The while loop
ends when the rectangle shrinks to nothing. In general outline, the algorithm
for drawing the applet is</p>

<pre>Set the drawing color to red  (using the g.setColor subroutine)
Fill in the entire applet (using the g.fillRect subroutine)
Set the drawing color to black
Set the top-left corner inset to be 0
Set the rectangle width and height to be as big as the applet
while the width and height are greater than zero:
    draw a rectangle (using the g.drawRect subroutine)
    increase the inset
    decrease the width and the height</pre>

<np>In my applet, each rectangle is 15 pixels away from the rectangle that
surrounds it, so the <code>inset</code> is increased by 15 each time through the
<code>while</code> loop. The rectangle shrinks by 15 pixels on the left
<b>and</b> by 15 pixels on the right, so the width of the rectangle
shrinks by 30 each time through the loop. The height also shrinks by 30 pixels
each time through the loop.</np>

<p>It is not hard to code this algorithm into Java and use it to define the
<code>drawFrame()</code> method of the applet. I've assumed that the applet has a height
of 160 pixels and a width of 300 pixels. The size is actually set in the source
code of the Web page where the applet appears. In order for an applet to appear
on a page, the source code for the page must include a command that specifies
which applet to run and how big it should be. (We'll see how to do that later;
see <localref href="control.ex.6"/> and <localref href="GUI1.2"/>.) It's not
a great idea to assume that we know how big the applet is going to be, as
I do here; I'll address that issue before the end of this
section. But for now, here is the source code for the applet:</p>

<pre>import java.awt.*;

public class StaticRects extends AnimationBase {
   
     public void drawFrame(Graphics g) {
         
         // Draw set of nested black rectangles on a red background.
         // Each nested rectangle is separated by 15 pixels on all sides
         // from the rectangle that encloses it.  The applet is
         // assumed to be 300 pixels wide and 160 pixels high.
         
      int inset;    // Gap between borders of applet and one of the rectangles.
                    
      int rectWidth, rectHeight;   // The size of one of the rectangles.
                    
      g.setColor(Color.red);
      g.fillRect(0,0,300,160);  // Fill the entire applet with red.
      
      g.setColor(Color.black);  // Draw the rectangles in black.
                                       
      inset = 0;
      
      rectWidth = 299;    // Set size of the first rect to size of applet
      rectHeight = 159;
      
      while (rectWidth &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; rectHeight &gt;= 0) {
         g.drawRect(inset, inset, rectWidth, rectHeight);
         inset += 15;       // rects are 15 pixels apart
         rectWidth -= 30;   // width decreases by 15 pixels on left and 15 on right
         rectHeight -= 30;  // height decreases by 15 pixels on top and 15 on bottom
      }
      
   }  // end paint()

}  // end class StaticRects</pre>

<p>(You might wonder why the initial <code>rectWidth</code> is set to 299, instead
of to 300, since the width of the applet is 300 pixels. It's because rectangles
are drawn as if with a pen whose nib hangs below and to the right of the point
where the pen is placed. If you run the pen exactly along the right edge of the
applet, the line it draws is actually outside the applet and therefore is not
seen. So instead, we run the pen along a line one pixel to the left of the edge
of the applet. The same reasoning applies to <code>rectHeight</code>. Careful
graphics programming demands attention to details like these.)</p>

<break/>

<p>When you write an animation applet, you get to build on <classname>AnimationBase</classname>
which in turn builds on the work of the people who
wrote the <classname>Applet</classname> class. The <classname>AnimationBase</classname> 
class provides a framework
on which you can hang your own work. Any programmer can create additional
frameworks that can be used by other programmers as a basis for writing
specific types of applets or stand-alone programs.  This makes it possible
for other programmers to build on their work even without understanding
in detail what goes on "inside" the code that they wrote.  This type of 
thing is the key to building complex systems!</p>

<p>Let's continue our example by animating the rectangles in our applet.
<web>The animated version is shown at the bottom of this page.</web><tex>You 
can see the animation in action at the bottom of
the on-line version of this section.</tex></p>

<p>In the animation, rectangles shrink continually towards the center of the
applet, while new rectangles appear at the edge. The perpetual motion is, of
course, an illusion. If you think about it, you'll see that the animation loops
through the same set of images over and over. In each image, there is a gap
between the borders of the applet and the outermost rectangle. This gap gets
wider and wider until a new rectangle appears at the border. Only it's not a
new rectangle. You are seeing a picture that is identical to the first picture
that was drawn.  What has really happened is that the animation has started over
again with the first image in the sequence.</p>


<p>In order to create motion in the animation, <code>drawFrame()</code> will
have to draw a different picture each time it is called.  How can it do that?
The picture that should be drawn will depend on the <newword>frame number</newword>,
that is, how many frames have been drawn so far.  To find out the current frame
number, we can use a function that is built into the <classname>AnimationBase</classname>
class.  This class provides the function
named <code>getFrameNumber()</code> that you can call to find out the
current frame number. This function returns the current frame number as an integer value.
If the value returned is 0, you are supposed to draw the first frame; if the
value is 1, you are supposed to draw the second frame, and so on.  Depending on 
the frame number, the <code>drawFrame()</code> method will draw different pictures.</p>

<p>In the animation that we are writing, the thing that differs from one frame to another is
the distance between the edges of the applet and the outermost rectangle. Since
the rectangles are 15 pixels apart, this distance increases from 0 to 14 and
then jumps back to 0 when a "new" rectangle appears. The appropriate value can
be computed very simply from the frame number, with the statement 
"<code>inset&nbsp;= getFrameNumber()&nbsp;%&nbsp;15</code>;". 
The value of the expression <code>getFrameNumber()&nbsp;%&nbsp;15</code> 
is always between 0 and 14. When the frame number reaches 15 or any multiple of 15, the value of
<code>getFrameNumber()&nbsp;%&nbsp;15</code> jumps back to&nbsp;0.</p>

<p>Drawing one frame in the sample animated applet is very similar to drawing
the single image of the original <classname>StaticRects</classname> applet.
We only have to make a few changes to the <code>drawFrame()</code> method.
I've chosen to make one additional improvement: The <classname>StaticRects</classname>
applet assumes that the applet is exactly 300 by 160 pixels. The new version,
<classname>MovingRects</classname>, will work for any applet size. To implement this, the
<code>drawFrame()</code> routine has to know how big the applet is. There are two
functions that can be called to get this information. The function
<code>getWidth()</code> returns an integer value representing the width of the
applet, and the function <code>getHeight()</code> returns the height. These functions
are inherited from the <classname>Applet</classname> class.
The width and height, together with the frame number, are used to compute the size of the
first rectangle that is drawn. Here is the complete source code:</p>

<pre>import java.awt.*;

public class MovingRects extends AnimationBase {


  public void init() {
        // The init() method is called when the applet is first
        // created and can be used to initialize the applet.
        // Here, it is used to change the number of milliseconds
        // per frame from the default 100 to 30.  The faster
        // animation looks better.
     setMillisecondsPerFrame(30);
  }


  public void drawFrame(Graphics g) {

         // Draw one frame in the animation by filling in the background
         // with a solid red and then drawing a set of nested black
         // rectangles.  The frame number tells how much the first 
         // rectangle is to be inset from the borders of the applet.
         
      int width;    // Width of the applet, in pixels.
      int height;   // Height of the applet, in pixels.
      
      int inset;    // Gap between borders of applet and a rectangle.
                    //    The inset for the outermost rectangle goes from 0 to
                    //    14 then back to 0, and so on, as the frameNumber varies.
                    
      int rectWidth, rectHeight;   // the size of one of the rectangles
                    
      width = getWidth();              // find out the size of the drawing area
      height = getHeight();

      g.setColor(Color.red);           // fill the frame with red
      g.fillRect(0,0,width,height);
      
      g.setColor(Color.black);         // switch color to black

      inset = getFrameNumber() % 15;   // get the inset for the outermost rect
                                       
      rectWidth = width - 2*inset - 1;    // set size of the outermost rect
      rectHeight = height - 2*inset - 1;
      
      while (rectWidth &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; rectHeight &gt;= 0) {
         g.drawRect(inset,inset,rectWidth,rectHeight);
         inset += 15;       // rects are 15 pixels apart
         rectWidth -= 30;   // width decreases by 15 pixels on left and 15 on right
         rectHeight -= 30;  // height decreases by 15 pixels on top and 15 on bottom
      }
      
   }  // end drawFrame()

}  // end class MovingRects</pre>

<p>The main point here is that by building on an existing framework, you can do
interesting things using the type of local, inside-a-subroutine programming
that was covered in <localref href="basics"/> and <localref href="control"/>. 
As you learn more about programming and
more about Java, you'll be able to do more on your own&mdash;but no matter how
much you learn, you'll always be dependent on other people's work to some
extent.</p>
